    "The basic units are each '**Janas**'. A jana is similar to a computing node of a neural network. Their task is to compute something. The currency of this world is computing. Each jana posseses a certain amount of computing currency called **Cupee**. Computing is a limited resource and hence each jana is allocated this probabilistically based on the amount of Cupees each has. The better they are at computing the more Cuppees they will get. They can form a cluster like a family and compute together for better computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cuppees are poured into the world by a computing task. Say I want to classify a paintings, I give input the painting and wait for the predicted output. If they predict right, then I will give large amount of cupees to the predictor. \n",
